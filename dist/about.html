        <p>I am a Web Developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different Front End and Back End languages,
            responsive frameworks, databases and best code practices. My objective is simply to be the best web developer 
            that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated

            strides to learn all that I can about development.
